The MicroMonitor source code distribution is configured to build
with the GNU native and cross-development tools.  In addition to those
tools, the makefiles under the MicroMonitor tree use a few other tools
all of which are either custom and are built under this source tree or
are publically available (i.e. cscope & ctags).

This directory contains the source code for the custom host-based tools
used with a MicroMonitor environment.  The majority of these tools can
be built with GNU tools or Visual C++ (VCC).

These tools have been successfully built on CYGWIN (using both GNU and VCC),
plus SOLARIS (SunOS 5.7) LINUX (RedHat-9 & others), and MacOS (using BASH
and GCC).

To do a complete build and cleanup using native GNU gcc run:

	"make OSTYPE=cygwin rebuild"
or
	"make OSTYPE=linux rebuild"
or
	"make OSTYPE=solaris rebuild"
or
	"make OSTYPE=macos rebuild"

depending on your host system.  To do a complete build and cleanup
for Cygwin using Visual C++ first make sure your environment is set
up to handle this.  Refer to the vcc_setup script under src/scripts.
Then run:

	"make OSTYPE=cygwin VCC=TRUE rebuild"

Note1: In all cases, the 'make' tool is assumed to be GNU.
Note2: The OSTYPE variable is usually established already in your
  environment; however, I've found that in some cases it isn't or it
  is but it isn't exported.  Adding this to the command line just
  guarantees that it is set properly for use by the make files.
Note3: Make sure your PATH is set up with the Cygwin tools in front.
  One common error on Cygwin is that 'find' is taken from Microsoft
  instead of /cygwin/bin.  This will cause this build to mess up.
Note4: The 'install' rule simply copies the executables to host/bin.
  If you prefer that they be installed elsewhere, then add BIN=dirname
  to the make line.
